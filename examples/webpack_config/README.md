# Loaders vs Rules
I'm still looking into the documentation for Webpack, however looks like the following two files do the same thing.
- example1.loaderskeyword.webpack.config.js
- example2.ruleskeyword.webpack.config.js

These files were used to import bootstrap into a dist folder using different methods.
